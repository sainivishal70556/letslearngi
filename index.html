                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">An Engineering Workshop has become important field in the industrial
                    atmosphere to
                    produce products for the service of mankind. The knowledge of converting a raw material
                    into a use full product is highly essential for all engineers for familiarizing with concepts. The
                    basic need of Engineering Workshop is to provide theoretical and practical knowledge of
                    manufacturing environment to all the engineering students. Therefore, an attempt has been
                    made through this laboratory subject to learn both the theoretical and practical knowledge of
                    shaping a product. Considering the general needs of engineering students in the country and
                    the fact that they hardly get any exposure to hand tools, equipments, machines and
                    manufacturing setups, a basic course in Engineering Workshop remains a core subject for
                    all the branches of engineering. This Engineering Workshop laboratory classes covers most
                    of the basic skill that an engineering students needs to familiarize themselves.
                    The Engineering Workshop laboratory in JIIT-128 has six major sections such as Machine
                    shop, Carpentry shop, Fitting Shop, Welding shop, Sheet metal shop and Moulding shop. The
                    utility of each shop in shaping engineering students in the manufacturing environment are
                    discussed as:
                    Machine shop: In a machine shop, metals are cut to different shapes as per the requirement
                    of the manufacturer. Major machines that are available in the JIIT-128 are lathe, shaper,
                    milling, drilling and grinding machine.
                    Carpentry shop: Carpentry shop deals with making joints for a variety of applications like
                    door frames, cabinet making furniture, packing etc.
                    Fitting Shop: The fitting shop is related to assembly of parts, after bringing the dimension or
                    shape to the required size or form, in order to secure the necessary fit.
                    Welding shop: In welding shop, an engineering student learns the art of joining similar
                    metals by the application of heat, with or without application of pressure or filler metal.
                    Sheet metal shop: In sheet metal shop an engineering student learns the art of making
                    various house hold articles such as boxes, cans, funnels, ducts etc., which are made from a
                    flat sheet of metals.
                    Moulding shop: Moulding shop is the platform where an engineering student learns the art
                    of making of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame
                    called a mould or matrix.</p>
